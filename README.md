# Tor-Pilot

Tor-Pilot is an open-source web application built with the Tornado framework, following the Model-View-Template (MVT) structure. It provides a boilerplate codebase that you can use as a starting point to develop web applications using Tornado.

## Features

- **MVT Structure**: Tor-Pilot follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern for organizing the codebase, making it easy to separate concerns and maintain a clean architecture.

- **URL Routing**: The application includes a flexible URL routing mechanism using Tornado's `URLSpec` class, allowing you to map URL patterns to corresponding view handlers.

- **Static Files Handling**: Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images can be served using Tornado's built-in `StaticFileHandler`, making it easy to include and manage static assets in your project.

- **Template Engine**: Tor-Pilot uses Tornado's template engine, allowing you to create dynamic HTML templates with support for template inheritance and template variables.

- **Configuration Settings**: The project includes a centralized settings file where you can customize various application settings such as debugging mode, cookie secrets, static file paths, and more.

2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Customize the application settings in `settings.py` according to your requirements.

4. Define your URL patterns and implement the necessary view handlers in the `urls.py` and `views.py` files under the `apps/main` directory.

5. Create your HTML templates in the `apps/main/templates` directory using Tornado's template syntax.

6. Run the application: `python server.py`

7. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8888/` (or the specified port).
